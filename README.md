License:  This is made from a hacked-up copy of https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/blob/master/examples/strandtest/strandtest.ino, which has a GPLv3 COPYING file, so I will do the same.

You are not legally required to, but I do kindly ask that if you use this your project, just let me know.  Especially if you use it comercially, I would be thrilled to be able to buy a properly manufactured candle featuring my algorithm :-)
